# Stock price predictions
The prediction of stock prices poses an intricate and demanding challenge within
the realm of finance. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML) methodologies has escalated the significance of stock price
prediction for investors, traders, and financial experts. This project unveils the basic way to 
predict stock price using Deep Learning methods namely using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) which are very well tuned to 
harness time-series relationships, ideal for this case.
